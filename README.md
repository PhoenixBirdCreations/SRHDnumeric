# Numerical integration of Special Relativistic Hydrodynamics (SRHD)

This folder contains the code to solve SRHD equations in 1D with a realistic equation of state. 

There are two folders, with code using two different approximate Riemann solvers. See details inside.

The integration is performed in third order of accuracy by using PHM or ENO reconstruction.
